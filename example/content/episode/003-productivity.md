In episode 3, we tackle one of the biggest challenges of modern life: staying
productive in an age of constant digital distractions.

## The Productivity Paradox

Despite having more tools and technology than ever before, many of us feel less
productive. We explore why this happens and what we can do about it.

## Evidence-Based Strategies

We share scientifically-backed methods for improving focus and productivity,
including:

- **Time-blocking**: Scheduling specific blocks of time for different tasks
- **The Two-Minute Rule**: If something takes less than two minutes, do it now
- **Energy Management**: Working with your natural energy rhythms
- **Digital Boundaries**: Creating separation between work and personal time

## Practical Implementation

We don't just talk theory – we provide step-by-step guides for implementing
these strategies in your daily life, whether you're a student, professional, or
entrepreneur.

Join us for this practical episode that will help you reclaim your time and
attention!
